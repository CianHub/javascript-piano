# JavaScript Piano

The JavaScript Piano is a simple, responsive web application that allows users to play the chords in the C Major musical scale using either their keyboard or by click the buttons on screen.

### Design

The application utilises a sparse responsive design. 

The design of the app consisted of two main goals, practising CSS transitions upon a key being triggered and creating a clear and sleek interface for the user.

## Features

The application has several features:

1. Users can play the chords in the C Major musical scale using their keyboard.
2. Users can play the chords in the C Major musical scale using their mouse.
